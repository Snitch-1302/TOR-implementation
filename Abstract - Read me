Abstract:

In the realm of Network Security, our project represents an extensive exploration of the renowned Tor network, which we've categorized into three distinct layers: Tor Basic, 
Intermediate, and Advanced. This collaborative venture, undertaken by our proficient three-member team, demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of Tor's intricate infrastructure 
and functionality. Our project aligns with the core principles of Tor while venturing into more advanced and innovative territory.In the Tor Basic phase, we delve into the foundations,
examining how users can attain basic online anonymity through Tor. The Intermediate level builds upon this, addressing the need for enhanced privacy and security. Our Advanced segment encompasses 
sophisticated techniques and novel features, providing an even higher level of network protection.With the combined expertise of our team, we aim to offer users an unparalleled experience 
in terms of online privacy and network security. Our project will not only contribute to the Tor ecosystem but will also serve as a valuable resource for both users and researchers in the field. 
This multifaceted approach elevates network security to new heights, ensuring robust protection for users and securing their digital identities in an increasingly interconnected world.
